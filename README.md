CocoaOpenGL-Swift
=================

This is a simple example of using Swift to create an OpenGL application for macOS, iOS, and tvOS. It features a rotating, normal mapped cylinder that is illuminated by three moving point lights of different colors.

Aside from the vertex and fragment shaders written in GLSL, all of the application code is written in Swift.
